                            maintenance or testing, or updates, including those required to reflect changes in relevant
                            laws and regulatory requirements; (b) We aim to evolve and improve the 24Six Service
                            constantly, and we may modify, suspend, or stop (permanently or temporarily) providing all
                            of part of the 24Six Service (including particular functions, features, and subscription
                            plans); (c) 24Six has no obligation to provide any specific content through the 24Six
                            Service, and 24Six or the applicable owners may remove particular songs, videos, podcasts,

                            Payments and cancellations section below), 24Six will refund you the prepaid fees for the

                            Billing - You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from 24Six by paying a subscription

                            disclosed to you prior to your purchase. Tax rates are calculated based on the information
                            you provide and the applicable rate at the time of your monthly charge.

                        <p>
                            Price and tax changes – 24Six may from time to time make changes to Paid Subscriptions,
                            including recurring subscription fees, and will communicate any price changes to you in
                            advance. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period
                            following the date of the price change and, by continuing to use the 24Six Service after the
                            price change takes effect, you will have accepted the new price. If you do not agree to a
                            price change, you can reject the change by unsubscribing from the applicable Paid
                            Subscription prior to the price change going into effect. Tax rates are based on the rates
                            applicable at the time of your monthly charge. These amounts can change over time with local
                            tax requirements in your country, state, territory, county, or city. Any change in tax rate
                            will be automatically applied based on the account information you provide.

                            Contact our Customer Support for instructions on how to cancel. The cancellation will take
                            effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be

                            filing an individual action under the arbitration agreement below within one (1) year after

                            omission, or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for
                            any claim not asserted within that time period. The parties expressly agree that any and all

                            breach thereof, if not disposed of by agreement, shall be submitted for resolution by
                            binding arbitration before the Beth Din of America (https://bethdin.org/). If the Beth Din

                            judge and those judges jointly designate a third judge. The decision of the arbitrators
                            shall be final and conclusive on the parties and shall be a bar to any suit, action or

                            except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive
