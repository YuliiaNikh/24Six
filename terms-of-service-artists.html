                            Artist Revenue Pool to individual song artists, will be in proportion to the number of
                            downloads generated by such song artist in comparison to the total number of downloads for
                            the relevant period. For the purposes of allocation of the Artist Revenue Pool, each
                            download must have been played for a minimum of 20 seconds. The allocation of the Artist
                            Revenue Pool shall be made by 24Six based solely on its data and its determination shall be
                            final and binding.

                            With 24Six’s music streaming service, users are able to subscribe, download and listen to
                            the song, hear the podcast and view the video offline. While offline, 24Six will still be
                            able to track offline use, however, such data will only become available once users go back
                            online. As a result, the streaming data of a particular song artist and the advertisement
                            revenue generated from a podcast or video are not fixed and will be subject to adjustment if
                            and when users come back online. Upon receipt of such data, 24Six will adjust the revenue
                            due to the song artists, podcasters, and video creators, which sum may be deducted or added
                            to the next distribution. In the event that an adjustment is made after you terminate this
                            Agreement, you should be entitled to receive such additional funds, or, you shall refund
                            such excess funds as the case may be. This provision shall survive termination of this
                            Agreement.
